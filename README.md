### [**Climbing Stairs**](https://github.com/AdamAdham/Algorithms/blob/main/Climb%20Stairs)
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

### [Pascal's Triangle](https://github.com/AdamAdham/Algorithms/blob/main/Pascal's%20Triangle.py)
Given an integer numRows, return the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:<br>

### [119. Pascal's Triangle II](https://github.com/AdamAdham/Algorithms/blob/main/119.%20Pascal's%20Triangle%20II.py)
Given an integer rowIndex, return the rowIndexth (0-indexed) row of the Pascal's triangle.

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown: <br>

### [338. Counting Bits](https://github.com/AdamAdham/Algorithms/blob/main/338.%20Counting%20Bits.py)
Given an integer n, return an array ans of length n + 1 such that for each i (0 <= i <= n), ans[i] is the number of 1's in the binary representation of i.

### [392. Is Subsequence](https://github.com/AdamAdham/Algorithms/blob/main/392.%20Is%20Subsequence.py)
Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

### [509. Fibonacci Number](https://github.com/AdamAdham/Algorithms/blob/main/509.%20Fibonacci%20Number.py)
The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.
